# Unity Commander
This is an implementation of a spotlight-like search for Unity 2018.3 using UI Elements. There are no plans to continue work on it now that Unity has their own quick search and there are still some problems with it, but maybe it is helpful for someone somewhere.
Note that UI Elements are still experimental in Unity 2018.3 and you have to put in some work to make it work in 2019.1+ that have changed the functionality of UI Elements in some places.
